## WARNING

This is a work in progress.

Im sorry, but the wiring ASCII is not updated. The code has very different wiring for the Nokia 5110 screen and the gps tx,rx.
The reason is that i threw this together quickly, and i already had a breadboard with wiring for software SPI for the nokia so im using that.

This WILL change once i sort out other issues - namely the op amp isnt working.

Cheers,
@micooke
